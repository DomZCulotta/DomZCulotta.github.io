# About Me
## My interestes
      - [Soccer] - This Sport is great to play but even better to watch and I have beem following it for about 4 years now
      - [Music] - Music is a big part of my life as it fills in all the quiet moments and helps me study and do other things
## Websites I recommend 
      - [Youtube] (https://www.youtube.com/) - So many different things you can learn form Youtube and many of these things 
        allow for visual learning which I find very helpful
      - [Mathway] (https://www.mathway.com) - When I was taking math classes and I was having trouble understanding how to get 
        the end of certain answers this website would show me a step by step answer while explaining very well of how to find my 
        answer. it helped me alot to learn whenI was struggling.
